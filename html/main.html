        Under these celebrating cheers and lights, all the memories slowly hit me. I’m standing by the quietest corner, but not quite in it—it’s already occupied. He is already standing there.

        “Are you leaving tomorrow?”

        He’s asking if I’m going back to my hometown after this New Year celebration. I looked at him, but he kept staring at the bright light cities across this concrete railing.

        “Uh, yeah, I guess. You?”

        I guess it was just formality of asking back, but I actually didn’t care—or, let me revise that—I didn’t want him to think that I still care.

        He answered no, and we fell into silence again. I hate that this isn’t awkward. We’ve gotten too comfortable with each other’s presence. Maybe that sounds good, but it confuses me about where to draw the line.

        Because when it comes to him, I just want to keep it short.

        There was a time when I, being the dumb stupid self that I was, fell for him. Not for his looks, or his personality, but for his intelligence. The way his mind thinks. But I fell out of him because of that same mind. He was simply too selfish and practical.

        “Hey, you two!” From behind us, a high, shrieking loud voice broke my divine deep thinking. “Come count or I’ll kick you out for being boring!”

        I laughed and ran inside. He just scoffed and walked slowly, keeping it cool. Like he always do.

        “…3, …2, …1! Happy New Year!”

        Glasses clinking and I took a shot. What a night this has been. Fine, maybe one more. Or another. And another …

        *

        Fuck. I woke up next to him. I must have drank too much. Again. This is getting predictable. This game with him which I never win.

        I always say I want it short and simple, like a goodbye text. But we keep bumping into each other, and the bumping becomes an accident, and my heart goes to ICU for that in the end, while his getting colder and colder.

        We once dreamt of having kids. Yes, plural. Two would be fun, but three would feel like having a cute trio in the house. We couldn’t decide. But look at us now. Who thought that one child would ruin us?

        I thought it would be a great idea to visit her cemetery after his dream last night. “Don’t you ever think that she probably needs both parents to be there sometimes?” I expressed my opinions, to which he just gave in. We never argue except for the day I wanted the divorce.

        But it suddenly rained.

        “Is she crying from above?” That wasn’t asked to anybody.

        “That’s what the therapist meant when she said more positive imagination, huh?”

        I roll my eyes to his remark.

        *

        I know that in a year, or maybe two, or maybe ten, this would all be okay. Maybe I’ll find somebody new, and he will too. Maybe we’ll both have kids again with our next partners.

        But right now my young mistake is weighing heavily.

        And I’m still figuring out how to end things properly.
