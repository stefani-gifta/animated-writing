This is a personal mini experiment that‚Äôs special to me because I'm finally writing for fun again, after years of writer's block.

The idea is to bring words to life‚Äîliterally‚Äîwhile I slowly rediscover the joy of storytelling and navigate academic burnout ü•¥

## Branches

- `main`: Basic typewriter
- `with-effects` (default): Typewriter animation with welcome page and sound effects

### The Difference

Basic typewriter (`main`):
- Typing animation with a fade-in effect
- Delays after punctuation for natural pacing
- Auto-scroll

Addition in `with-effects` branch:
- Sound effects triggered by specific words
- Highlight on trigger words
