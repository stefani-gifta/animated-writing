## Personal Note

This mini project is special because it marks my return to finally writing fictional stories for personal fulfillment again, after years of writing primarily for formal evaluation.
It’s a creative experiment to bring words to life—literally—as I rediscover the joy of storytelling and rebuild a forgotten habit that once came naturally.
